	I was searching the web one fine day as you are doing today, <br>
	and was not able to find an online resource to test some SOAP functionlity <br>
	I was building into a PHP application.  <br>
	I was unable to find a useable one that didn't have to be downloaded.  <br>
	Soo .. I decided to make one.<br>
	<br>
	This is kinda still in a beta stage and I would welcome any feedback you have.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks,
	<br>
	David
